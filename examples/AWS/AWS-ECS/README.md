# Chronos AWS ECS Example

Deploy AWS ECS for testing [Chronos](https://github.com/open-source-labs/Chronos), an open-source developer tool that monitors health data from servers, microservices, Kubernetes clusters, and now, AWS services.

## Purpose and Design

This sample AWS ECS example allows developers to explore the functionality of Chronos with cloud-based applications.

ECS cluster is deployed with following process:

- build Docker Image
- upload to Docker hub or ECR
- update docker-compose file
- create and use docker context
- deploy application

### If want to install Chronos as dependency (optional)

1: add a `.env` file to the _server_ folder that contains the following key/value pairs:

- `CHRONOS_DB`: `MongoDB` or `PostgreSQL`
- `CHRONOS_URI`: The URI to the desired MongoDB or PostgreSQL database to save health metrics via **Chronos**

2: Then look at the `package.json` file in the server folder and note how `@chronosmicro/tracker` is included as a dependency:

- If the @chronosmicro/tracker dependency is listed as a remote npm package (i.e. `"@chronosmicro/tracker": "^8.0.1"`), no further work is needed.

- If the @chronosmicro/tracker dependency is listed as a local npm package (i.e. `"@chronosmicro/tracker": "^12.0.1"`), the Docker build will require that the the Chronos code is in this folder. Copy the _chronos_npm_package_ folder in manually.

## Deploy application in ECS

Step 1: build Docker Image

```
docker build -t ecs-test:1.0 .
```

- If you want to change name and/or tag of docker image, please make sure to update docker-compose.yaml file accordingly. And do Not miss the . at the end as it denotes location of the Dockerfile

Step 2: docker-compose to test out image (image is stored locally right now)

```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

Step 3: Upload image to docker hub or ECR, update docker-compose.yaml with new URI of image

- you only need to update the image for ecs-test, mongo and mongo-express are pulled from docker public library

Step 4: Set up AWS account, grant access to floowing AWS IAM permissions listed [here](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#requirements). Some other permissions you would need includes:

- iam:DeleteRolePolicy
- iam:PutRolePolicy
- ecr:GetAuthorizationToken
- logs:TagResource
- elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem

If you push docker image in ECR you might need additional permission as well.

Step 5: Generate access key in IAM -> Users -> yourusername -> secureity credentials -> Access Keys. _Make sure you save your secret access key as it is only accessible once when generated._ (These are used for launching Chronos (instruction at the end)

Step 6: Create and use AWS context, follow instruction [here](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#requirements).

Step 7: Deploy test application in ECS

```
    docker compose up
```

## Monitoring ECS instance on Chronos

1. Start Chronos desktop application.

2. Select `cloud-based`

3. Use Access Key, Secret Access Key, and region to start monitoring ECS instance.

### Some notes about the ECS-test

The way deployment set up is using Fargate, you will not be able to see graphs in ECS cluster->metrics. Instead, check inside services or Cloudwatch.
